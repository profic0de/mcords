# MCords

**MCords proxy** is a custom Minecraft proxy server written in Python designed for flexibility, extensibility, and full control over client-server interaction. Built to support modern Minecraft versions, `mcords` enables advanced packet manipulation, authentication passthrough, and other core networking features for Minecraft modders and server developers.
